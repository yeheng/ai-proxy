# AI Proxy Product Overview

AI Proxy is a high-performance Rust-based API gateway that unifies multiple AI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) into a single, consistent interface.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Unified API**: Single endpoint for all AI providers using Anthropic API format as the standard
- **Provider Agnostic**: Easy switching between different AI services without client code changes
- **High Performance**: Built with Rust and async/await for maximum efficiency
- **Real-time Streaming**: SSE support for streaming responses from all providers
- **Production Ready**: Docker and Kubernetes deployment support with comprehensive error handling

## Key Features

- Adapter pattern for standardizing different AI provider APIs
- Gateway pattern for centralized request routing and response handling
- Stream processing with real-time response streaming and format conversion
- Extensible architecture for adding caching, monitoring, and authentication
- Configuration-driven provider management with hot-reload capability

## Target Use Cases

- Applications needing to switch between AI providers without code changes
- Cost optimization by routing to different providers based on requirements
- Fallback mechanisms when primary providers are unavailable
- Unified monitoring and logging across multiple AI services
- Rate limiting and authentication for AI API access
